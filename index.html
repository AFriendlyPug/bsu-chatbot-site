                                <p>Chatbot conversation flow is the backbone of any successful chatbot interaction. In order to provide a seamless experience to users, chatbots must be programmed to lead conversations and ask relevant questions. <br><br> We used tool x to create a guide to script out an expected conversation flow with the user. The aim was to create a well-structured conversation flow ensures that users are engaged and their needs are met.</p>

                                <p>The chatbot has not only been programmed to answer specific questions but also to understand the flow of conversation and anticipating the responses of both the user. By mapping out the conversation flow and possible user responses, we have been able to plan for the chatbot's ability to deliver consistent, relevant answers. This means that users get the information they need without getting stuck in a loop of unhelpful responses. By providing the chatbot with the appropriate answers to use, the conversation stays on track and that the user leaves feeling satisfied.</p>

                                <p>Chatbot design plays a critical role in facilitating user interaction, ensuring that users can easily navigate and engage with chatbots. Our team understood the importance of user-centric design and the need to create custom designs that align with users' needs. Our chatbot design is focused on providing users with an intuitive interface that enables them to interact with chatbots easily. We prioritize design elements that facilitate easy navigation, the ability to quickly start a conversation, and an aesthetically pleasing visual interface.</p>

                                <p>Integrating IBM's Watson AI into NodeRED enables the chatbot to utilize powerful features such as speech-to-text, data collection and analysis,custom chatbot designs, and natural language processing. This allows us to tailor the user and empowers the chatbot with additonal features it wouldn't normally have giving the user the best experience possible and streamline the process of developing the chatbot to have everything join all in once place.</p>
